//
// I2C Detector - scan and identify devices on an I2C bus using the BitBang_I2C library
// 
// The purpose of this code is to provide a sample sketch which can serve
// to detect not only the addresses of I2C devices, but what type of device each one is.
// So far, I've added the 25 devices I've personally used or found to be reliably detected
// based on their register contents. I encourage people to do pull requests to add support
// for more devices to make this code have wider appeal.

// There are plenty of I2C devices which appear at fixed addresses, yet don't have unique
// "Who_Am_I" registers or other data to reliably identify them. It's certainly possible to
// write code which initializes these devices and tries to verify their identity. This can
// potentially damage them and would necessarily increase the code size. I would like to keep
// the size of this code small enough so that it can be included in many microcontroller 
// projects where code space is scarce.
